# Hundreds of ways to visualize genomic data.

This site provides a database of genomic visualization tools. Each tool has been sorted and grouped based on various attributes, and this website has been designed to help you find what you’re looking for. Our review article on genomic visualization tools (*Tasks, Techniques, and Tools for Genomic Data Visualization*) can be found [here.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13727)

## Contributing

GenoCAT is a crowdsourced resource. Data visualization tool developers can [add their own tools](/submission/) to GenoCAT or edit any errors users may come across when browsing through tool pages.
