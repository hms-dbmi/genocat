GenoCAT is a crowdsourced resource. Data visualization tool developers can add their own tools to GenoCAT or edit any errors users may come across when browsing through tool pages. Tool are organized into Markdown files and can be accessed via our GitHub repository. You can find the Markdown files for all tools on the website in this <a href="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/genocat/tree/master/_tools">folder</a>. <br><br>

To add a new tool, first fork our repository on GitHub. Using <a href="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/genocat/blob/master/template.md">template.md</a>, create a Markdown file for your tool following the instruction below and upload it into “_tools”. <br><br>

The following describes each parameter in the template. Do not change the first parameter. It must remain ‘layout: tool’. Please follow the outlined instructions (e.g., brackets and quotations) when indicated. This allows for multiple characteristics if your tool supports multiple characteristics and should be indicated as such: [“linear”, “circular”]. If a parameter doesn’t apply for your tool, leave it blank.<br><br>

<a href="http://genocat.tools/attributes/layout.html#Space%20Filling">Space-filling:</a><br>
The space-filling curve displays a more global overview of the genome while maintaining the spatial distribution of features, for example, using a Hilbert or other space-filling curve. <br>

Choose from the following interaction types: [“linear”, “circular”, “spatial”, “spacefilling”], and use brackets and double quotations (e.g. [“linear”]) <br><br>
